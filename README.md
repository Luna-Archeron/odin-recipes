This project is my first attempt to build a website with the knowledge I have acquired so far in The Odin Project.

Once the project is completed it will demonstrate that I have basic understanding of how HTML and Visual Studio Code works. 
In addition, I will use GitHub to save my progress, thus improving my commit messages and getting used to atomic commits.
Lastly, I will be exclusively using the command line instead a GUI to practice the commands I know and become comfortable with it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this file!
