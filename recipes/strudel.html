    <h3>What's a strudel?</h3>

        <p>Strudle is a Austrian layered pastry with a filling that is usually sweet. The one we will be teaching you to make today is one of the best-known varieties, made from
            apples. In this version we will only be using non-animal-derived ingredients to make this a compassionate dish. </p>

    <h3>What will you need?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Apples</li>
                <li>Walnuts</li>
                <li>Flour (we will use all-purpose flour)</li>
                <li>Vegan frozen puff pastry</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Non-dairy milk (we will use oat milk)<i>Optional</i></li>
                <li>Powdered sugar <i>Optional</i></li>
                <li>Spices
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cinnamon</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>Lemon juice</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>How to do it?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the puff pastry out of the freezer.</li>
                <li>Peel and slice the apples. Put them on a mixing bowl and add the flour, walnuts, lemon juice, plain sugar, cinnamon and salt. Mix it all together.</li>
                <li>Roll you pastry on a sheet of parchment paper in a rectangular shape and cut 2-cm wide strips along the long sides of the rectangle.</li>
                <li>Arrange the apple mix in the middle of the rectangle making sure it doesn't get to the edge where the cuts you made begin.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200ÂºC</li>
                <li>Fold the strips inwards and over the filling.</li>
                <li>Brush the pastry with the non-dairy milk and place it on the oven. Once the crust is golden and the filling is softer you can take it out.</li>
                <li>Carefully sprinkle the powdered sugar on top. Let it cool for a while and enjoy warm!</li>
            </ol>

        <p><i>Guten appetit!</i> You can enjoy it alone or with some vegan vanilla ice cream.</p>
