    <h2>What's a paella?=</h2>

        <p>A paella is a traditional dish that originated from the East coast of Spain, more specifically the Valencian region. It consists of round-grain rice, bajoqueta and 
        garrofó (varieties of green bean and butter bean respectively) and rabbit, chicken or duck. In this version we will be teaching you how to make a compassioned paella.

             <li>Garrofó or giant butter beans (we will use pre-cooked ones)</li>
             <li>Onions</li>
             <li>Garlic</li>
             <li>Extra-virgin Olive Oil</li>
             <li>Your preferred chicken substitute (we will use Oumph!) <i>Optional</i> </li>
             <li>Spices
                <ul>
                    <li>Rosemary</li>
                    <li>Saffron</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>Smoked Paprika</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
        </ul> 

    <h2>How to do it?</h2>
        
    <ol>
        <li> Add oil to a big pan and add your chicken substitute if you chose to include it in your recipe.</li>
        <li> Chop onions in little squares and chop garlic even smaller. When your substitute is sealed, add onion and garlic to the pan.</li>
        <li> Add garrofó and bajoqueta once onions are softer. You can add your spice, except saffron, and mix them well. Make sure they don't get burned.</li>
        <li> When beans are somewhat cooked, cover everything with water. In a separate recipient mix your saffron with warm water and when it releases its colour
            add to the pan.</li>
        <li> When the waters comes to a boil, arrange the ingredients however you like as once you add the rice <strong>you cannot not mix it</strong>. Then, add 
            the rice in a way it everywhere in the pan and make sure it's under the water. From now on, don't stir the mix. Leave it to cook on medium to low fire. </li>
        <li> When the water is consumed, turn off the fire. Cover the pan with foil and let it sit for 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
