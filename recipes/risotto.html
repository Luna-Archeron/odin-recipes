    <h3>What's a risotto?</h3>

         <p>Risotto is a rice dish, typically made with a high-starch round-grain rice, that is cooked in broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. It originated in the northern
        regions of Italy. In this version, we will not be including <i>Parmigiano</i> nor a animal-derived broth so as to make a compassionate dish. </p>

    <h3>What will you need?</h3>
            
            <ul>

            <li>Round-grain rice (we will use a variety called <i>Arborio</i></li>
            <li>A high quality vegetable broth</li>
            <li>Your favourite mushrooms (we will use <i>Shiitake</i> and champignon)</li>
            <li>Onions and garlic</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Spices
                <ul>

                    <li>Parsley</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
    <h3>How to do it?</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Chop the mushrooms in not too small chunks and saut√© them in oil with some garlic. Reserve for later.</li>
                <li>Heat your vegetable broth and incorporate the saffron to it.</li>
                <li>Dice onions and garlic and add them to the pan where you'll cook your risotto with some oil and wine at medium heat. Once soft add your rice. <strong>Do not wash the rice 
                    before adding it</strong>. Toast it for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add a cup of the vegetable broth and stir it continuously. Once you notice it's absorbed add another cup. Repeat this step adding <b>one cup at a time</b> until 
                    the rice is <i>al dente</i>. Then, turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms to the risotto along with the parsley and mix it together. Serve immediately.</li>
